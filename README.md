    <h3>LATEST UPDATE [8/26/23]:</h3> The bot has been fixed :)
    <br>
      <details close>
        <summary><h3>UPDATE [14/06/24]:</h3></summary> As of June  14th, 2024, ValoStats will be offline from Discord. The platform used to host this bot, whitedevil, will no longer allow hosting for free. At this time, I do not have the funds to be able to continue hosting ValoStats. Also, the API     usage with Tracker Network has changed and the bot cannot retrieve stats properly. 
      <br><br>In the future, I may plan to use Riot's official Valorant API and revive this project. 
      <br><br>I am proud to inspire hundreds of other bright developers to make a Valorant Stats Discord bot like this. I am also pleased that thousands of Valorant users have been able to use and enjoy my first big side project for their gaming experience.
      <br><br>Thank you for supporting and using ValoStats for the past year.
